Welcome to Big Data Processor's documentation!
==============================================
Big Data Processor (BDP) is a light-weight, yet complete and scalable workflow platform.
This web workbench not only focus on **workflow portability**, **reproducibility** and **reusiblity** but also **portable data visualizations**.
Most workflow management systems can only help us to execute and monitor workflows. Users have to find their way to explore the results.
Here, with our Page system, users can visualize results interactively right after workflow executions, since package developers can freely develop web interfaces for their specific workflows.

**All on web pages!**

This web workbench provides web interfaces that covers project management, workflow executions, task monitoring, and even portable package building.
Packages of BDP are in a portable format that can be installed on every BDP hosts by just mouse clicks.
Then, these workflows in the packages are ready to run with near-zero configurations!

The coolest part is that we also provides the web proxy functionality. Our Page system can serve containerized web services or even desktop applications such as R/Shiny apps, RStudio, Jupyter Notebookor Matlab IDE and many more!
