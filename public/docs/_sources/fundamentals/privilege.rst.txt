==========
Privileges
==========

To provide multi-user working environments, we provide basic privilege settings for Projects and Packages.
In addition, we also provide users of different levels and these privileged are interrelated.
Interaction results of these privileges produce the actual privileges and define valid user actions.  


Project Privilege
=================
There are four positions for each Project: the owner, project managers, task runners and project viewers.

A user who created the project becomes the project owner.
Project owner can assign other users for the four positions, and these positions can have more than one user.

It is worth noting that the project owner can give away the position to others or even to no one.
Projects of no owners can still be used by users of other positions.
As the following privilege table shows, projects of no owners won't be able to be deleted unless the administrators delete them.  

It is important to note that a Project can be set public, so that every registered user can view the project (read-only).
That is, every registered user is a project viewer for public projects.

Package Privilege

Just like the Project privileges, there are four similar positions of the same names for each Package.

+------------+--------------+-----------------+------------------+----------------+------------------------+

\ :sup:`1`\ Task Runner can only use the Tasks in the Package but not view the task settings.

\ :sup:`2`\ Just like the project managers, managers of a Package can neither change the owner nor manage managers.

As the above table, we separate the privileges to view and to use the Package,
Because sometimes package authors may want to keep their source codes or workflows privately before releasing or publishing,

Setting a Package to be public means privileged users can view the Package contents and execute tasks in the package.
Here, privileged users mean that users may require some user privilege levels. Please see the next sections.


User privileges
===============

In addition to the privileges of Project and Package, Big Data Processor also comes with basic user privilege settings.
The user privileges must be satisfied first and the granted Package or Project privileges are thus valid.
For example, to be able to view Package contents, users need to be ``Task Builders`` or higher.
Even if a normal user is chosen as a ``Package Viewers``, that user is not able to see the Package contents.
The following table lists the user positions and their privileges.


+-------------------+--------------+-----------------+----------------+----------------+----------------+----------------+
| Position          | View Project | Create Project  | Manage Project | View Package   | Create Package | Manage Package |
+===================+==============+=================+================+================+================+================+

``Power User`` has advanced operations to import files from host paths and to execute Tasks in the Packages which is ``experimenting`` or ``under development``.
``Normal User`` can only execute Tasks of Packages that are marked ``Stable``.
